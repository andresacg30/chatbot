# chatbot
My first chat bot, with the JetBrains Academy help!

This simply chatbot will introduce itself, ask your name, guess your age, count from 0 to a number that you give to it and ask you a programming question, veryfing is correct or not.
This chatbot was made with a simple-beginner python code. As my first repository, the main idea of publishing it here is to explore GitHub and its options.
